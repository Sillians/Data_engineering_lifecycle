## Data Engineering Described

Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engi‐ neering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A data engineer manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.

- "A data engineer’s goal is to move fast, get traction, and add value."


### The stages of the data engineering lifecycle are as follows:
• Generation
• Storage
• Ingestion
• Transformation • Serving

### Data Engineering skills and 
- security, 
- data management, 
- DataOps, 
- data architecture, and 
- software engineering.

### Data Maturity Model
- Starting with Data: Define the right data architecture (usually solo, since a data architect likely isn’t available). This means determining business goals and the competitive advantage you’re aiming to achieve with your data initiative. Work toward a data architec‐ ture that supports these goals.

- Scaling with Data: 
    - Establish formal data practices
    - Create scalable and robust data architectures
    - Adopt DevOps and DataOps practices
    - Build systems that support ML
    - Continue to avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting and customize only when a competitive advantage results.

- Leading with Data
    - Create automation for the seamless introduction and usage of new data
    - Focus on building custom tools and systems that leverage data as a competitive advantage
    - Focus on the “enterprisey” aspects of data, such as data management (including data governance and quality) and DataOps
    - Deploy tools that expose and disseminate data throughout the organization, including data catalogs, data lineage tools, and metadata management systems

### The Background and Skills of a Data Engineer
This requires a good understanding of software engineering, DataOps, and data architecture. 
- Business Responsibilities
- Technical Responsibilities
    - Recall the stages of the data engineering lifecycle:
        • Generation
        • Storage
        • Ingestion
        • Transformation
        • Serving
    - The undercurrents of the data engineering lifecycle are the following:
        • Security
        • Data management
        • DataOps
        • Data architecture
        • Orchestration
        • Software engineering
