## Ingestion

You’ve learned about the various source systems you’ll likely encounter as a data engineer and about ways to store data. Let’s now turn our attention to the patterns and choices that apply to ingesting data from various source systems. The key engineering considerations for the ingestion phase, the major patterns for batch and streaming ingestion, technologies you’ll encounter, whom you’ll work with as you develop your data ingestion pipeline, and how the undercurrents feature in the ingestion phase.

### What is Ingestion?

Data ingestion is the process of moving data from one place to another. Data inges‐ tion implies data movement from source systems into storage in the data engineering lifecycle, with ingestion as an intermediate step.
